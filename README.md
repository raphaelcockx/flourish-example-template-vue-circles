# Using the Flourish SDK with vue.js

This sample template demonstrates how to implement the [circle example](https://github.com/kiln/example-template-circle) in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). It does so while sticking as close as possible to the generated skeleton template (`flourish new`), using Rollup to bundle the JavaScript code and Vue single-file component(s) and Less to compile stylesheets.
